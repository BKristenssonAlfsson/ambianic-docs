Ambianic is an Open Source Ambient Intelligence platform that puts local control and privacy first. It enables users to train and share custom AI models without compromising privacy. View on Github The 5 Whys What's the root cause for Ambianic.ai to exist? Below is a 5 Whys diagram that tries to provide objective answers: Needless to say there are subjective reasons which are equally if not more influential for the existence of this project such as basic human excitement to serve a bigger purpose via open source AI. User Journey Ambianic's roadmap is inspired by user stories and community feedback. The following diagram illustrates an example user journey. User journeys help us align on the bigger picture and segue into agile development constructs such as user stories and sprints. More user journeys will be added over time as the project evolves. Some of the candidate topics include: Home Automation Turn traditional door locks into smart locks with Face Recognition. Alert parents if a crying toddler is left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Raise an alert if a baby is seated near a car door without child lock enabled while in motion. Business Automation Prevent accidents by alerting drivers who act sleepy or distracted. Make sure that a factory floor position is not left unattended for more than 15 minutes. Recognize presence of unauthorized people in a restricted access work area. User - System Interactions Users interact with the system in two phases: First Time Installation Consequent App Engagements The following diagram illustrates the high level user - system interactions. User Interface Flow The User Interface is centered around three main activities: Setup Ambianic Edge to communicate with smart home devices: sensors, cameras, microphones, lights, door locks, and others. Design flows to automatically observe sensors and make helpful recommendations. Review event timeline, alerts and actionable recommendations. Ambianic UI is an Offline-First PWA (Progressive Web Application). PWAs work in any browser, but \"app-like\" with features such as being independent of connectivity, install to home screen, and push messaging depend on browser support. Ambianic UI does not assume that the user has constant broadband internet access. Its built to handle a range of real world scenarios with low bandwidth or no-Internet access at all when the user may need to review Ambianic alerts, events timeline, edit flows and configure edge devices. Ambianic UI stores data locally on the client device (mobile or desktop) and, when there\u2019s a network connection, syncs data to the user's Ambianic server and resolves any data conflicts. When possible it communicates directly with local Ambianic Edge devices minimizing network routing overhead. Product Design Goals Our goal is to build a product that is useful out of the box: Less than 15 minutes setup time Less than $75 in hardware costs Primary platform: Raspberry Pi 4 B, 4GB RAM, 32GB SDRAM No coding required to get started Decomposable and hackable for open source developers Quick Start If you would like to try the latest version, follow the steps in the Quick Start Guide . Community Support If you have questions, ideas or cool projects you'd like to share with the Ambianic team and community, please use the Ambianic Twitter channel . Contributors If you are interested in becoming a contributor to the project, please read the Contributing page and follow the steps.

Two types of plugins are supported: Edge plugins, and UI plugins Edge plugins execute in an Ambianic Edge device environment, whereas UI plugins execute in the Ambianic UI PWA environment. It is common for a plugin to be built as a package with an Edge and an UI plugin designed to work together for a smooth end-to-end user experience. Let's take for example a VideoSource plugin that reads data from video streams such as live security camera feeds and feeds image frames to an Ambianic AI flow for inference such as person detection. The plugin will have two parts: An edge device plugin VideoSourceEdge which will reside in an Ambianic Edge device and execute in the core Ambianic runtime. It will be installed and configured on the edge device via secure shell access, its public REST APIs or GUI exposed by the VideoSourceUI plugin. An UI plugin VideoSourceUI which will implement GUI widgets for users to configure and control VideoSource connections.

Ambianic UI is pre-deplyed and readily available at https://ui.ambianic.ai . If you are familiar with Docker you will be able to install Ambianic Edge in less than 5 minutes. Ambanic Edge Deployment Ambianic Edge is available as a docker image for ARM and x86 architectures so it can be deployed on most modern machines and operating systems. The reference test system is: Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM and 32GB SD card . To deploy on a Raspberry Pi 4, you will need a recent Raspbian install with Docker on it . You can install and run the image in the default pi user space on Raspbian. Starting Ambianic Edge # check if there is an image update docker pull ambianic/ambianic-edge # run latest image docker run -it --rm --name ambianic-edge \\ --mount type=bind,source=$PWD,target=/workspace \\ --net=host ambianic/ambianic-edge You can stop the image with CTRL+C or docker stop ambianic-edge Ambanic UI Ambianic UI is a modern prorgressive web application (PWA) that provides Plug-and-Play pairing and remote access to an Ambianic Edge device. Ambianic UI shows a timeline view with important events around your home organized chronologically. Below is an example timeline screenshot. Pairing Ambanic UI with Ambianic Edge You can easily pair up your Ambianic UI with Ambianic Edge. It works similar to Airdrop. Make sure to open Ambianic UI on the same local network where Ambianic Edge runs. Ambianic UI will initially display a welcome screen. If you click on Settings, it will show a pairing page like the one below: After a few moments, pairing will conclude and you will see the unique identifier of your Ambianic Edge device. Congratulations! Your Ambianic instance is now up and running! Configuration You are now read to configure input sources (e.g. cameras) for Ambianic to observe and apply AI inference to. Learn more . Once you configure Ambianic Edge, you should be able to see timeline view like the one above. The pairing information is persisted on your Ambianic UI client device and you can now access Ambianic Edge from anywhere remotely! The connection is direct and encrypted end-to-end. Troubleshooting If you experience problems with your initial setup and you can't find a good solution online, feel free to engage the team on Twitter or open a github issue .","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"users/quickstart/#5-minutes-quick-start","text":"Ambianic's main goal is to provide helpful and actionable suggestions in the context of home and business automation.
